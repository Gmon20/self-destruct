# self-destruct
Opens a window that closes itself after 5 seconds

More specifically, it displays text with an error icon that pretty much just says "this will explode very soon," and then after 5 seconds an explosion sound effect plays and then the window closes itself.

Yes, this is a very silly bunch of code. But I was bored and have had this idea in the back of my mind for ages now so I decided to make it lol

This isn't supposed to be anything super serious-I just made this for fun. So if any future employers are seeing this don't take it too seriously lol
